# Ethical Penetration Testing Tutorial

This tutorial introduces ethical penetration testing concepts in a controlled lab environment. All activities must be authorized and confined to the lab network.

## Learning outcomes

- Understand legal and ethical boundaries.
- Practice reconnaissance, enumeration, and reporting.
- Apply least-impact techniques for lab testing.

## Lab setup

- Use the Mahakaal OS VM with host-only networking.
- Provision a deliberately vulnerable target (e.g., Metasploitable or a DVWA VM).
- Ensure snapshots are available.

## Walkthrough

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Identify the lab IP range.
   - Run safe discovery scans (`nmap -sn`).
2. **Enumeration**
   - Focus on one service.
   - Use version detection (`nmap -sV`) and verify findings.
3. **Analysis**
   - Map findings to known vulnerabilities.
   - Document risks and mitigations.
4. **Reporting**
   - Record steps, results, and remediation guidance.

## Safety checklist

- No internet-facing targets.
- Use throttling and safe scan flags.
- Never reuse lab credentials elsewhere.
